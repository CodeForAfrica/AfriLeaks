        <div class="question" data-translate>What is the difference to Wikileaks?</div>
        <div class="answer" data-translate>Publeaks does not overlap with Wikileaks. Wikileaks seeks and publishes its own information, Publeaks is nothing more than a mailbox. Publeaks makes use of the software Globaleaks. This is maintained by a core group of developers with the open source community.</div>
        <div class="question" data-translate>How do you select media organisations?</div>
        <div class="answer" data-translate>The media organisations must fulfill two criteria: having statutory objectives and subscribing to the code of the international federation of journalists (code of Bordeaux). We approached several of them personally, others signed u[p.</div>
        <div class="question" data-translate>Why is the Publeaks connection so slow?</div>
        <div class="answer" data-translate>The connection to the secure Publeaks installation goes through the Tor network. Tor is a network of virtual tunnels that enable improved privacy and security on the internet. Tor sends your traffic through three random servers (also called relays) before the traffic is send to the public internet. The disadvantage is that this can make the connection very slow. The advantage is that this protects your anonymity.</div>
        <div class="question" data-translate>Does declaring information involve danger?</div>
        <div class="answer" data-translate>Yes, it is certainly not without risk. On this website, we try to give as much information as possible about the risks. The system makes tracing the leaks more difficult, to impossible. The whistleblower and journalist are responsible for their own actions.</div>
